		<p>
		    Snail jumpy was born when a friend and I decided to create a game from "scratch"
		    in less than two weeks. Its primary outcome was that of an excellent learning
		    experience and because of this the source code is incredibly messy. The game is
		    classifiable as a platformer. It is played by jumping from platform to platform
		    or to cloud or to mushroom while avoiding snails and collecting coins. All of the game's
		    sound effects were created by our vocals and mouths.

		<p>
		    Due to the poor quality of the original Snail Jumpy and the joy involved in creating it
		    a friend and myself have decided upon creating Snail Jumpy 2.0. This new version of
		    Snail Jumpy is more similar to an actual release version whereas the original Snail Jumpy
		    was more a proof of concept or an an alpha version of sorts. Snail Jumpy 2.0 will have
		    sound effects that are produced in the fashion, the same style of art, more enemies,
		    more advanced gameplay, as well as being more professional. However despite our eagerness
		    we have yet to begin work on Snail Jumpy 2.0 so it is <b>COMING SOON</b>
